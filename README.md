# Introduction to HTML and CSS

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to create and organize the content of a website. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used for design and layout. Together, these languages form the foundation of what one needs to know to create websites that are useful and well-designed.

By the end of this workshop, participants will:

- Familiarize themselves with the anatomy of a webpage and how the Internet works.
- Understand the basics of the HTML and CSS markdown languages.
- Use HTML, CSS, and a text editor to build a small website
